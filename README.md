Here's a playground where you can try out WASI modules.

It has these WASI runtimes:

- wasmtime
- wasmer

And these runtimes are planning to be added:

- wasmedge
- wain

> Note: This playground is still in development. It may not work as expected.
>
> Note: wasmedge will only test on docker environment.
